**NCDHC(National Children’s Digital Health Collaborative)**  
NCDHC is a collabarative initative of Australian Digital Health Agency,eHealth NSW and the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network.The focus of the Collaborative to explore how digital health technology can help make Australia the best practice model for mothers experiencing pregnancy, going through the birthing process and nurturing and raising a child. The initiatives have the aim of improving the health and wellbeing of all Australian children and expectant mothers, irrespective of their location, socioeconomic status or cultural background.Following initatives are in the scope:

**Child Digital Health Record (CDHR)**  
The Child Digital Health Record (CDHR),intends to capture a participating child’s valuable health and development information, currently recorded in hard-copy baby books,through electronic means.
This would enable the easy and secure access of the child's health records by the parents and health-care providers when and where it is needed.

The CDHR proof-of-concept being trialled by the National Children’s Digital Health Collaborative does not require changes to existing processes,or to the type of information captured in local systems.The CDHR receives data for consented children from local clinical information systems and presents it to clinicians through a “Provider Viewer” and to consumers through “consumer applications”.Consumer entered data will also be available through the consumer applications.


**Digital Pregnancy Health Record (DPHR)**  
The Digital Pregnancy Health Record (DPHR),intends to capture a participating expectant mother's valuable health and development information, currently recorded in hard-copy pregnancy records,through electronic means.A Digital Pregnancy Health Record will capture this information digitally so it is easily accessible by the mother and healthcare providers, making it readily available when and where it is needed. 


The **CDHR** and **DPHR** proof of concept enables the exchange of information through a series of **health interactions** in real time within a defined privacy and consent framework.
It utilises child and expectant mother's Health Interaction data from existing National, Jurisdictional and Non-Jurisdictional systems clinical systems and includes the 
capture of consumer Health Interaction data by parents and families through the use of consumer apps.The Health Interaction model is predicated on interoperability 
between systems collecting child and pregnant mother health information.It is intended that these systems will be able to publish elements of that information as Health Interactions to share with the Child Digital Health record and Digital Pregnancy Health Record,as well as being able to subscribe and display interactions originating from other systems.



**Health Interaction(HI)** is a term used by the NCDHC to describe a point in time when health related information is exchanged.  A Health Interaction could be:

     - a Clinical Health Interaction with a health-care provider e.g. a child’s health assessment with a GP or community nurse,a mothers initial examination , scheduled antenatal appointment or pathology result 

     - a Consumer Health Interaction allows the consumer to input or view information through the consumer application e.g. height information. The consumer who has access to this information is the authorised representative of the child (e.g. parent/guardian) or a nominated representative granted access to the record by the authorised representative (e.g. grandparent). 

     - a Technical Health Interaction e.g. a notification sent to a consumer e.g. a notification advising of a missed immunisation,a notification sent to a mother advising of a missed appointment

     - an Administrative Health Interaction e.g. a consumer consenting to participate in the Child Health Record Program,a mother consenting to participate in the Digital Pregnancy Health Record program



This guide covers the capability requirements of FHIR services to implement various profiles and support interfaces in an Australian context for the purpose of 
implementation of the CDHR and DPHR.
This document is a working specification that is expected to be implemented and tested by FHIR®© system producers to enable feedback to improve the content of this guide.
## Scope
To be added
## Usage
This document is a working specification that may be directly implemented by FHIR®© system producers.

Information contained in this document is aimed at providing guidance on representing Australian local concepts using FHIR. This includes code systems, extensions and profiles on base FHIR types. The content of the IG is general in nature and seeks to provide a ‘how-to’ guide when representing concepts, it includes core base profiles that can be further constrained for a particular usage.

## Collaboration
This guide is the product of collaborative work undertaken with participants from:


* HL7 Australia Orders and Observations Working Group
* HL7 Australia Medications Working Group
* HL7 Australia Patient Administration Working Group
* Australian Digital Health Agency
* Australian FHIR Implementers' Community
* HL7 Australia Members
